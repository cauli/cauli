### Hi!
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for Tradeshift in Copenhagen. 
I really like to work on small games, interactive stuff in general, but haven't doing much so lately. 

#### 9 to 5
During my dayjob I currently work as a Globalization developer, dealing with all the difficult parts of making a platform actually global, usable and understandable by the perspective of the widest audience of users, from compliance and translations to tools and libraries for developers.

#### Random stuff about me
- I've studied Design, but have been working as a developer for many years. I don't think I am an Engineer, but they insist on calling me that.
- All my plants have names ðŸŒ±
- I might want to live aboard a sailboat one day
