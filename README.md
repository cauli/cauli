### Hi!
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for Tradeshift in Copenhagen. 

I really like to work on small games, interactive stuff in general, but haven't doing much so lately. 

#### 9 to 5
I currently work as a Globalization developer, dealing with the difficult parts of making a platform global, understandable by the widest audience, from compliance and translations to tools and libraries for developers.

#### Random stuff about me
- 👨‍💻 I've studied Design, but have been working as a developer for many years. I don't think I am an Engineer, but they insist on calling me that.
- 🌱 All my plants have names 
- ⛵ I might want to live aboard a sailboat one day
